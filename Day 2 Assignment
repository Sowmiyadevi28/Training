Assignment 1: 
      Pseudocode and Flowchart for Sorting Algorithm - Write pseudocode and create a flowchart for a bubble sort algorithm.
Provide a brief explanation of how the algorithm works and a simple array of integers to demonstrate a dry run of your algorithm.

 Start
Input an array of integers
Set n to the length of array
Repeat the following steps for i from 0 to n-1:
Repeat the following steps for j from 0 to n-i-1:
If the element at index j is greater than the element at index j+1:
Swap the elements at index j and j+1
End

Assignment 2:
    Recursive Function and Efficiency Analysis - Write a recursive function pseudocode and calculate the nth Fibonacci
number and use Big O notation to analyze its efficiency. Compare this with an iterative approach and discuss the pros and cons in terms of space and time complexity.

start
Function fibonacci(n):
    if (n==0):
        Return 0
    else if(n==1)
        Return 1
    else
        Return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
end
